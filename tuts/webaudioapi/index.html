    ~ Distance ~

    Alone I walk in the crisp morning air
    Kicking rocks as I go
    Reminiscing on old days
    Hoping to see you again
    
    I see the sun wake
    It shines so bright 
    Sunrays embrace me in the cool morning air
    Holding only me for just a moment
    
    I close my eyes 
    And raise my arms out to the sun
    But the sun goes away reaching towards the sky
    Leaving me below, all alone again 
    
    I stand in the shadows it creates
    Yet see how the rest of the world lights up again
    I want to be in that world with you
    But in the shadows we stand
    
    Maybe one day, the sun will find us both
    And dissolve all the darkness around
    And let us stay with them 
    Embraced in the morning light always.
