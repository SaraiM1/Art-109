    <p id="textformat">Art project Still Here is a digital art project that includes poetry, audio, and a 3d model that is meant to narrate the thought process someone struggling with depression might have. The poem written for this project revolves around a character who is depressed and acknowledges people close to them are also in depression, and how they wish and desire to get better, but can only witness the world moving forward while reminiscing on old times. Separation in this project is further emphasized by having two separate lands. One land is more vibrant which represents the world and old memories the character has, while the other land is more dull and represents the dark place the character is in mentally. The 3d model in this artwork was created using Blender and is an interactive piece, which allows the viewer the opportunity to have a closer look at the work. The creation of Still Here was influenced by my own experiences when dealing with depression and experiencing the inevitable disconnection I feel towards others while feeling depressed. The poem I wrote, named Distance, demonstrates the emotional and physical disconnection and distance I experience while struggling with depression. However, the purpose of making Still Here, is to give way to talk about mental health, and bring to surface the loneliness that can come with it. The end goal hopefully being, to remind others to be kind and check in on loved ones, or to check in with yourself, when times are rough.

      Alone I walk in the crisp morning air
      Kicking rocks as I go
      Reminiscing on old days
      Hoping to see and be with you again
      
      I see the sun wake
      It shines so bright 
      Sunrays embrace me in the cool morning air
      Holding only me for just a moment
      
      I close my eyes 
      Hoping the warmth I feel never goes away
      But the sun goes on reaching towards the sky
      Leaving me below, all alone again 
      
      I stand in the shadows it creates
      And see how the rest of the world lights up again
      I want to be in that world with you
      I want to feel those old warm, happy memories again
      
      The sun comes and goes, and I want to go with it
      To stay with the sun
      So it dissolve all the darkness around me
      To let it dissolve all the darkness around you
      
      Maybe one day, the sun will stay with us
      And dissolve all the darkness around
      And let us stay with them 
      Embraced in the warmth always.
